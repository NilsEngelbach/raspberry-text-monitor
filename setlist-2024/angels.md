I sit and wait
does an angel contemplate my fate
And do they know
The places where we go,
When we’re grey and old?
´cause I’ve been told
That salvation - lets their wings unfold

So when I’m lyin‘ in my bed
Thoughts runnin‘ through my head
And I feel that love is dead
I’m lovin‘ angels instead

~refrain~
And through it all
She offers me protection,
A lot of love and affection
Whether I’m wright or wrong
And down the waterfall
Wherever it may take me,
I know that life won’t break me,
When I come to call
She won’t forsake me
I‘m loving angels instead.
~/refrain~

When I’m feeling weak
And my pain walks down
A one way street
I look above
And I know I’ll always be blessed with love
And as the feeling grows She brings flesh to my bones
And when love is dead – I’m loving angels instead.
