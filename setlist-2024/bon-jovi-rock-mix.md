RUNAWAY
~/bridge~

On the street where you live girls talk about their social lives
They're made of lipstick, plastic and paint
A touch of sable in their eyes

All your life – all your life - all you asked
When’s your Daddy gonna talk to you
But we're living in another world
Tryin' to get your message through

No one heard a single word you said
They should have seen it in your eyes
What was going around your head

~refrain~
Oh, she's a little runaway
Daddy's girl learned fast
All those things he couldn't say
Ooh, she's a little runaway
~/refrain~

IT’S MY LIFE
~/bridge~

This ain't a song for the broken-hearted
No silent prayer for the faith-departed
I ain't gonna be just a face in the crowd
You're gonna hear my voice
When I shout it out loud

~refrain~
It's my life
It's now or never
I ain't gonna live forever
I just want to live while I'm alive
(It's my life)
My heart is like an open highway
Like Frankie said
I did it my way
I just want to live while I'm alive
It's my life
~/refrain~

LIVIN’ ON A PRAYER
~/bridge~

Tommy used to work on the docks, union's been on strike
He's down on his luck, it's tough, so tough
Gina works the diner all day working for her man
She brings home her pay, for love, for love

She says, we've got to hold on to what we've got
It doesn't make a difference if we make it or not
We've got each other and that's a lot for love
We'll give it a shot

~refrain~
Woah, we're half way there
Woah, livin' on a prayer
Take my hand, we'll make it I swear
Woah, livin' on a prayer
~/refrain~

**(Tonartwechsel)**

~refrain~
Woah, we're half way there
Woah, livin' on a prayer
Take my hand, we'll make it I swear
Woah, livin' on a prayer
(Livin' on a prayer)

YOU GIVE LOVE A BAD NAME
~/bridge~

Shot through the heart, and you're to blame, darling
You give love a bad name

An angel's smile is what you sell
You promise me heaven then put me through hell
Chains of love, got a hold on me
When passion's a prison you can't break free

You're a loaded gun, yeah
There's nowhere to run
No-one can save me, the damage is done

~refrain~
Shot through the heart, and you're to blame
You give love a bad name
I play my part and you play your game
You give love a bad name
~/refrain~

**(Tonartwechsel)**

~refrain~
Shot through the heart, and you're to blame
You give love a bad name
I play my part and you play your game
You give love a bad name
