**Bad Romance**
~/bridge~
 
Roma, roma-ma 
Gaga, ooh-la-la 
Want your bad romance 
Rah, rah-ah-ah-ah 


Roma, roma-ma 
Gaga, ooh-la-la 
Want your bad romance 


I want your ugly, I want your disease 
I want your everything as long as it's free 
I want your love 
Love, love, love, I want your love (hey) 

I want your drama, the touch of your hand (hey) 
I want your leather-studded kiss in the sand 
I want your love 
Love, love, love, I want your love (love, love, love) 
(I want your love) 

You know that I want you 
And you know that I need you 
I want it bad, your bad romance 

I want your love, and I want your revenge 
You and me could write a bad romance (oh-oh-oh-oh-oh) 
I want your love and all your lover's revenge 
You and me could write a bad romance 

Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh 
Caught in a bad romance 
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh 
Caught in a bad romance 

Rah, rah-ah-ah-ah 
Roma, roma-ma 
Gaga, ooh-la-la 
Want your bad romance

**Born This Way** 
~/bridge~
 
My mama told me when I was young, "We are all born superstars" 
She rolled my hair and put my lipstick on in the glass of her boudoir 

"There's nothing wrong with loving who you are" 
She said, "'Cause He made you perfect, babe 
So hold your head up, girl, and you'll go far" 
Listen to me when I say 

I'm beautiful in my way 'cause God makes no mistakes 
I'm on the right track, baby, I was born this way 
Don't hide yourself in regret, just love yourself, and you're set 
I'm on the right track, baby, I was born this way (born this way) 
Ooh, there ain't no other way, baby, I was born this way 
Baby, I was born this way (born this way) 
Ooh, there ain't no other way, baby, I was born this way 
Right track, baby, I was born this way 

I'm beautiful in my way 'cause God makes no mistakes 
I'm on the right track, baby, I was born this way

**Paparazzi** 
~/bridge~
 
We are the crowd 
We're c-coming out 
Got my flash on, it's true 
Need that picture of you 
It's so magical 
We'd be so fantastical 

Leather and jeans 
Garage glamorous 
Not sure what it means 
But this photo of us 
It don't have a price 
Ready for those flashing lights 
'Cause you know that baby I 

~refrain~
I'm your biggest fan 
I'll follow you until you love me 
Papa-paparazzi 
Baby, there's no other superstar 
You know that I'll be 
Your papa-paparazzi 
Promise I'll be kind 
But I won't stop until that boy is mine 
Baby, you'll be famous 
Chase you down until you love me 
Papa-paparazzi

5x
Mum-mum-mum-mah 

I wanna hold 'em like they do in Texas, please 
Fold 'em, let 'em hit me, raise it, baby, stay with me (I love it) 
Love game intuition, play the cards with spades to start 
And after he's been hooked, I'll play the one that's on his heart 

Oh, whoa, oh, oh 
Whoa, oh, oh 
I'll get him hot, show him what I've got 
Oh, whoa, oh, oh 
Whoa, oh, oh 
I'll get him hot, show him what I've got 


2x
~refrain~
Can't read my, can't read my 
No, he can't read my poker face 
(She's got me like nobody) 
Can't read my, can't read my 
No, he can't read my poker face 
(She's got me like nobody)
