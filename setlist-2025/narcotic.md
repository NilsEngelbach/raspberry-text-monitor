So you face it with a smile
There is no need to cry
For a trifle's more than this

Will you still recall my name?
And the month it all began
Will you release me with a kiss

Have I tried to draw the veil?
If I have how could I fail
Did I fear the consequence?

Dazed by careless words
Cosy in my mind

~bridge~
2x
I don't mind
I think so
I will let you go
~/bridge~

Now you shaped that liquid wax
Fit it out with crater cracks
Sweet devotion, my delight

Oh, you're such a pretty one
And the naked thrills of flesh and skin
Would tease me through the night

Now I hate to leave you bare
If you need me I'll be there
Don't you ever let me down

Dazed by careless words
Cosy in my mind

~bridge~
2x
I don't mind
I think so
I will let you go
~/bridge~

And I touched your face
Narcotic mind from lazed Mary Jane
And I called your name
Like an addicted to cocaine
Calls for the stuff he'd rather blame

And I touched your face
Narcotic mind from lazed Mary Jane
And I called your name
My cocaine

~bridge~
7x
I don't mind
I think so
I will let you go
