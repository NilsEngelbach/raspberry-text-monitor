Now I′ve had the time of my life
No, I've never felt like this before 
Yes, I swear it′s the truth
And I owe it all to you 

**'Cause I've had the time of my life** 
**And I owe it all to you**

I′ve been waiting for so long
Now I′ve finally found someone
To stand by me 

**We saw the writing on the wall 
As we felt this magical 
Fantasy**

_Now with passion in our eyes_
_There's no way we could disguise it secretly_
_So we take each other′s hand_
_'Cause we seem to understand_
_The urgency_

Just remember 
**You′re the one thing**
I can't get enough of 
**So I′ll tell you something**
_This could be love because_

_I've had the time of my life_
_No, I never felt this way before_ 
_Yes, I swear it's the truth_ 
_And I owe it all to you_ 

Hey, baby

**With my body and soul**
**I want you more than you′ll ever know**

So we′ll just let it go
Don't be afraid to lose control, no 

**Yes, I know what′s on your mind**
**When you say, stay with me tonight**

Just remember 
You're the one thing 
**I can′t get enough of**
So I'll tell you something 
_This could be love because_

_I′ve had the time of my life_
_No, I never felt this way before_
_Yes, I swear it's the truth_
_And I owe it all to you_
_'Cause I′ve had the time of my life_
_And I′ve searched through every open door_
_Till I found the truth_
_And I owe it all to you_
