The snow glows white on the mountain tonight 
Not a footprint to be seen 
A kingdom of isolation 
And it looks like I'm the queen 

The wind is howling like this swirling storm inside 
Couldn't keep it in, heaven knows I tried 

Don't let them in, don't let them see 
Be the good girl you always have to be 
Conceal, don't feel, don't let them know 
Well, now they know 

~refrain~
Let it go, let it go 
can't hold it back anymore 
let it go, let it go 
turn away and slam the door 
i don't care what they're going to say 
let the storm rage on 
the cold never bothered me anyway 
~/refrain~

It's funny how some distance makes everything seem small 
And the fears that once controlled me can't get to me at all
It's time to see what I can do 
To test the limits and break through 
No right, no wrong, no rules for me 
Weâ€™re free 

~refrain~
Let it go, let it go 
i am one with the wind and sky 
let it go, let it go 
you'll never see me cry 
here i stand and here i stay
let the storm rage on
~/refrain~

My power flurries through the air into the ground 
(My soul is spiraling in frozen fractals all around)
And one thought crystallizes like an icy blast
I'm never going back, the past is in the past 

~refrain~
Let it go, let it go 
and i'll rise like the break of dawn 
let it go, let it go 
that perfect girl is gone 
here i stand in the light of day 
let the storm rage on (storm rage on) 
the cold never bothered me anyway
~/refrain~
