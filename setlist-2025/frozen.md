=gold=The snow glows white on the mountain tonight 
Not a footprint to be seen 
A kingdom of isolation 
And it looks like I'm the queen=/gold=

=gold=The wind is howling like this swirling storm inside 
Couldn't keep it in, heaven knows I tried=/gold=

=red=Don't let them in, don't let them see 
Be the good girl you always have to be 
Conceal, don't feel, don't let them know 
Well, now they know=/red= 


**=red=Let it go=/red=, =gold=let it go=/gold=
can't hold it back anymore 
let it go, let it go 
turn away and slam the door 
=gold=i don't care what they're going to say=/gold=
=red=let the storm rage on=/red=
the cold never bothered me anyway**

=red=It's funny how some distance makes everything seem small 
And the fears that once controlled me can't get to me at all=/red=
=gold=It's time to see what I can do 
To test the limits and break through 
No right, no wrong, no rules for me=/gold= 
**Weâ€™re** free 

**=gold=Let it go=/gold=, let it go 
i am one with the wind and sky 
let it go, let it go 
you'll never see me cry 
=gold=here i stand=/gold= =red=and here i stay=/red=
=gold=let the storm rage on=/gold=**

=red=My power flurries through the air into the ground=/red=
=gold=(My soul is spiraling in frozen fractals all around)=/gold=
=red=And one thought crystallizes like an icy blast=/red=
=gold=I'm never going back,=/gold= the past is in the past 

**Let it go, let it go 
and i'll rise like the break of dawn 
let it go, let it go 
that perfect girl is gone 
=gold=here i stand=/gold= =red=in the light of day=/red=
=gold=let the storm rage on=/gold= =red=(storm rage on)=/red= 
=gold=the cold never bothered me anyway=/gold=**
