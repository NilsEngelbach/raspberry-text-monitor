Oh baby baby, Oh baby baby 

Oh baby baby, how was I supposed to know 
That something wasn′t right here 
Oh baby baby, I shouldn't have let you go 
And now you′re out of sight, yeah 
Show me how you want it to be 
Tell me baby 'cause I need to know now 
Oh, because 

~refrain~
My loneliness is killing me (and I) 
I must confess I still believe (still believe) 
When I'm not with you I lose my mind 
Give me a sign 
Hit me baby one more time
~/refrain~
 
Oh baby, baby, the reason I breathe is you 
Boy you′ve got me blinded 
Oh pretty baby, there′s nothing that I wouldn't do 
It′s not the way I planned it 

Show me how you want it to be 
Tell me baby 'cause I need to know now 
Oh, because 

~refrain~
My loneliness is killing me (and I) ...

Oh baby baby, how was I supposed to know? 
 
Oh pretty baby, I shouldn't have let you go 

I must confess, that my loneliness 
Is killing me now 
Don′t you know I still believe 
That you will be here 
And give me a sign 
Hit me baby one more time 

~refrain~
My loneliness is killing me (and I) ...
~/refrain~

I must confess, that my loneliness 
Is killing me now 
Don′t you know I still believe 
That you will be here 
And give me a sign 
Hit me baby one more time
