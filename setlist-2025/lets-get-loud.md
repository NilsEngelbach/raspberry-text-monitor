C'mon, people
Let's get loud, let′s get loud 
Turn the music up, let's do it 
C'mon, people 
Let's get loud, let′s get loud 
Turn the music up, let's do it 

Let's get loud, let′s get loud 
Turn the music up, let's do it 
C'mon, people

If you wanna live your life
live it all the way and don′t you waste it 
 
Every feeling, every beat 
Can be so very sweet, you gotta taste it 

~bridge~

You gotta **do it**
you gotta do it your way 
You gotta **prove it**
you gotta mean what you say
~/bridge~
 
Life's a party, make it hot 
Dance don't ever stop, whatever rhythm 
 
Every minute, every day 
Take them all the way, you gotta live ′em 

~bridge~
You gotta do it ...

Let′s get loud, let's get loud 
Turn the music up to hear that sound 
Let′s get loud, let's get loud 
Ain′t nobody gotta tell ya what you gotta do

Life is meant to be big fun 
you′re not hurting anyone nobody loses 

Let the music make you free, be what you wanna be 
Make no excuses

You gotta do it ...
