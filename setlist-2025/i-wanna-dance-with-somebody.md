Clock strikes upon the hour 
And the sun begins to fade 
Still enough time to figure out 
How to chase my blues away 

I've done alright up 'till now 
It's the light of day that shows me how 
And when the night falls, loneliness calls 

~refrain~
Oh, I wanna dance with somebody 
I wanna feel the heat with somebody 
Yeah, I wanna dance with somebody 
With somebody who loves me 
Oh, I wanna dance with somebody 
I wanna feel the heat with somebody 
Yeah, I wanna dance with somebody 
With somebody who loves me 
~/refrain~

I've been in love and lost my senses 
Spinning through the town 
Sooner or later, the fever ends 
And I wind up feeling down 

I need a man who'll take the chance 
On a love that burns hot enough to last 
So when the night falls 
My lonely heart calls 

~refrain~
Oh, I wanna dance with somebody ...
~/refrain~

I need a man who'll take the chance 
On a love that burns hot enough to last 
So when the night falls 
My lonely heart calls 

~refrain~
Oh, I wanna dance with somebody ...
~/refrain~


Ooh ooh (dance) 
Come on baby (dance) 
Ooh, yeah (dance) 
Now get with this 
Whoah!
