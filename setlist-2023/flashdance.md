First when there′s nothing
But a slow glowing dream
That your fear seems to hide
Deep inside your mind
All alone I have cried
Silent tears full of pride
In a world made of steel
Made of stone

Well, I hear the music
Close my eyes
Feel the rhythm
Wrap around
Take a hold of my heart

~refrain~
What a feeling
Being's believing
I can have it all
Now I′m dancing for my life

Take your passion
And make it happen
Pictures come alive
You can dance right through your life
~/refrain~

Now I hear the music
Close my eyes
I am rhythm
In a flash
It takes hold of my heart

~refrain~
What a feeling
Being's believing
I can have it all
Now I'm dancing for my life

Take your passion
And make it happen
Pictures come alive
You can dance right through your life

What a feeling (I am music now)
Being′s believing (I am rhythm now)
Pictures come alive
You can dance right through your lifeee

What a feeling (I can really have it all)
What a feeling (pictures come alive when I call)
I can have it all (I can really have it all)
Have it all (pictures come alive when I call)
(Call, call, call, call, what a feeling)

What a feeling (I am music now)
Being′s believing (I am rhythm now)
Pictures come alive
You can dance right through your life
~/refrain~

What a feeling
