Well, it's one for the money
Two for the show
Three to get ready
Now go, cat, go

~refrain~
But don't you
Step on my blue suede shoes
Well, you can do anything
But lay off of my blue suede shoes
~refrain~

Well, you can knock me down
Step in my face
Slander my name
All over the place

Well, do anything that you want to do, but uh-uh
Honey, lay off of my shoes
And don't you
Step on my blue suede shoes
Well, you can do anything
But lay off of my blue suede shoes

~refrain~
Zwischenspiel
~refrain~

Well, you can burn my house
Steal my car
Drink my liquor
From an old fruit jar

Do anything that you want to do
But uh-uh, honey, lay off of my shoes

~refrain~
And don't you
Step on my blue suede shoes
Well, you can do anything
But lay off of my blue suede shoes
~refrain~

Well, it's blue, blue blue, suede shoes
Blue, blue, blue suede shoes
Yeah, blue, blue, blue suede shoes
Baby, blue, blue, blue suede shoes
Well, you can do anything
But lay off of my blue suede shoes

Well, it's one for the money
Two for the show
Three to get ready
Now go, go, go

~refrain~
But don't you
Step on my blue suede shoes
Well, you can do anything
But lay off of my blue suede shoes
~refrain~

Well, it's blue, blue blue, suede shoes
Blue, blue, blue suede shoes
Yeah, blue, blue, blue suede shoes
Baby, blue, blue, blue suede shoes

~refrain~
Well, you can do anything
But lay off of my blue suede shoes
~refrain~
