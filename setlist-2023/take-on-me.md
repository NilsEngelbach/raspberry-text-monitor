Talking away
I don't know what left to say
I'll say it anyway
Today's not my day to find you
Shying away
I'm coming for okay

~refrain~
Take on me (take me on)
Take on me (take me on)
I'll be gone in a day or two
~/refrain~

So needless to say at odds and ends
But I'll be stumbling away
Slowly learning that life is okay
Say after me
It's so much better to be safe than sorry

~refrain~
Take on me (take me on)
Take on me (take me on)
I'll be gone in a day or two
~/refrain~

Oh, things that you say
Yeah, is it life or just a play
My worries away
You're all the things I've got to remember
You shine away
I'll be coming for your love

~refrain~
Take on me (take me on)
Take on me (take me on)
I'll be gone in a day or two

Take on me (take me on)
Take on me (take me on)
I'll be gone in a day or two

Take on me
Take on me
~/refrain~
