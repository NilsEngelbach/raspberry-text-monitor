I used to think maybe you love me now baby I'm sure
and I just can't wait till the day when you knock on my door
Now every time I go for the mailbox gotta hold myself down
'cause I just can't wait till you write me you're coming around

~refrain~
Now I'm walking on sunshine oh oh
I'm walking on sunshine oh oh
I'm walking on sunshine oh oh
and don't it feel good hey alright now
and don't it feel good hey yea
~/refrain~

I used to think maybe you loved me now I know that it's true
and I don't wanna spend my whole life just a-waiting for you
now I don't want you back for the weekend not back for a day no no no
I said baby I just want you back and I want you to stay oh yea

~refrain~
I'm walking on sunshine oh oh
I'm walking on sunshine oh oh
I'm walking on sunshine oh oh oh
and don't it feel good hey alright now
and don't it feel good yea oh yea yea
and don't it feel good
~/refrain~

~bridge~
Walking on sunshine

I feel alive I feel in love I feel in love that's really real
I feel alive I feel in love I feel in love that's really real
I'm on sunshine baby oh oh yea

~refrain~
I'm walking on sunshine oh oh
I'm walking on sunshine oh oh
I'm walking on sunshine oh oh oh
and don't it feel good hey alright now

And don't it feel good hey yea now
and don't it feel good now don't don't don't don't don't don't

~/refrain~
