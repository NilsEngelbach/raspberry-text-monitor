I saw him dancin' there by the record machine
I knew he must've been about 17
The beat was goin' strong Playin' my favorite song
And I could tell it wouldn't be long 'Til he was with me, yeah, me
And I could tell it wouldn't be long 'Til he was with me, yeah, me, singin'

~refrain~
"I love rock 'n roll
So put another dime in the jukebox, baby
I love rock 'n roll
So come and take your time and dance with me"
Ow!
~/refrain~

He smiled, so I got up and asked for his name
"That don't matter", he said, "'Cause it's all the same"
Said, "Can I take you home where we can be alone?"
And next, we were movin' on, he was with me, yeah, me
Next, we were movin' on, he was with me, yeah, me, singin'

~refrain~
"I love rock 'n roll
So put another dime in the jukebox, baby
I love rock 'n roll
So come and take your time and dance with me"
Ow!
~/refrain~

Said, "Can I take you home where we can be alone?
Next, we were movin' on, he was with me, yeah, me
And we'll be movin' on and singin' that same old song
Yeah, with me, singin'

~refrain~
[3x]
"I love rock 'n roll
So put another dime in the jukebox, baby
I love rock 'n roll
So come and take your time and dance with me"
~/refrain~
