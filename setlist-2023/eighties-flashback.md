Thriller
~refrain~

It′s close to midnight
Something evil's lurkin′ in the dark
Under the moonlight
You see a sight that almost stops your heart
You try to scream
But terror takes the sound before you make it
You start to freeze
As horror looks you right between the eyes
You're paralyzed

'Cause this is thriller
Thriller night
And no one′s gonna save you
From the beast about to strike

You know it′s thriller
Thriller night
You're fighting for your life
Inside a killer, thriller tonight, yeah

~refrain~
Time After Time
~refrain~

Sometimes, you picture me
I′m walking too far ahead
You're calling to me
I can′t hear what you've said
Then you say, "Go slow"
I fall behind
The second hand unwinds

If you're lost, you can look, and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall, I will catch you, I′ll be waiting
Time after time
If you fall, I will catch you, I'll be waiting (I will be waiting)
Time after time

Time after Time

~refrain~
Eye of the Tiger
~refrain~
Rising up, back on the street
Did my time, took my chances
Went the distance, now I'm back on my feet
Just a man and his will to survive

It's the eye of the tiger
It's the thrill of the fight
Rising up to the challenge of our rival
And the last known survivor
Stalks his prey in the night
And he's watching us all with the eye of the tiger

~refrain~
Up Where We Belong
~refrain~

Who knows what tomorrow brings
In a world few hearts survive
All I know is the way I feel
When it′s real, I keep it alive

The road is long
There are mountains in our way
But we climb a step every day

Lord lift us up where we belong
Where the eagles cry, on a mountain high

Lord lift us up where we belong
Where the eagles cry, on a mountain high
Lord lift us up where we belong
Far from the world below, up where the clear winds blow

~refrain~
You Give Love a Bad Name
~refrain~

An angel′s smile is what you sell
You promised me Heaven, then put me through Hell
Chains of love got a hold on me
When passion's a prison, you can't break free

Whoa-oh-oh, you′re a loaded gun, yeah
Whoa-oh-oh, there′s nowhere to run
No one can save me, the damage is done

Shot through the heart and you're to blame
You give love a bad name (bad name)
I play my part and you play your game
You give love a bad name (bad name)

Hey, you give love
A bad name
