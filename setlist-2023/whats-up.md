**Twenty-five years and my life is still**
Trying to get up that great big hill of hope
For a destination

**I realized quickly when I knew I should**
That the world was made up of
This brotherhood of man
For whatever that means

~refrain~
And so I cry sometimes
When I'm lying in bed
Just to get it all out
What's in my head
And I am feeling a little peculiar
And so I wake in the morning
And I step outside
And I take a deep breath and I get real high
And I scream from the top of my lungs
What's going on?
And I say, hey hey hey hey
I said hey, what's going on?
~/refrain~

Ooh, ooh ooh

**And I try, oh my god do I try**
I try all the time, in this institution
And I pray, oh my god do I pray
I pray every single day For a revolution.

~refrain~
And so I cry sometimes...
~/refrain~

**And I say, hey hey hey hey**
I said hey, what's going on?

And I say, hey hey hey hey
I said hey, what's going on?

**Twenty-five years and my life is still**
Trying to get up that great big hill of hope
For a destination
