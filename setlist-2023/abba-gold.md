Dancing Queen
~/refrain~

You can dance, you can jive
Having the time of your life, ooh
See that girl, watch that scene
Dig in the Dancing Queen
Friday night and the lights are low
Looking out for a place to go
Where they play the right music, getting in the swing
You come to look for a king

Anybody could be that guy
Night is young and the music′s high
With a bit of rock music, everything is fine
You're in the mood for a dance

And when you get the chance

You are the Dancing Queen
Young and sweet, only seventeen
Dancing Queen
Feel the beat from the tambourine, oh yeah
You can dance, you can jive
Having the time of your life, ooh
See that girl, watch that scene
Dig in the Dancing Queen

Mamma Mia
~/refrain~

I′ve been cheated by you since I don't know when
So I made up my mind, it must come to an end
Look at me now, will I ever learn
I don′t know how, but I suddenly lose control
There's a fire within my soul

(Just one look) and I can hear a bell ring
(One more look) and I forget everything, whoa

Mamma mia, here I go again
My, my, how can I resist you? 
Mamma mia, does it show again
My, my, just how much I've missed you?
Yes, I′ve been brokenhearted
Blue since the day we parted
Why, why did I ever let you go?
Mamma mia, now I really know
My, my, I could never let you go



~refrain~
Fernando
~/refrain~

Can you hear the drums, Fernando?
I remember long ago another starry night like this
In the firelight, Fernando
You were humming to yourself and softly strumming your guitar
I could hear the distant drums
And sounds of bugle calls were coming from afar
There was something in the air that night
The stars were bright, Fernando
They were shining there for you and me
For liberty, Fernando
Though we never thought that we could lose
There's no regret
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando



~refrain~
The winner takes it all
~/refrain~

So the winner takes it all
And the loser has to fall

I don′t wanna talk
About things we've gone through
Though it′s hurting me
Now it's history

I've played all my cards
And that′s what you′ve done too
Nothing more to say
No more ace to play

The winner takes it all
The loser's standing small
Beside the victory
That′s her destiny

The winner takes it all (takes it all)
The loser has to fall (has to fall) 
It's simple and it's plain (it's so plain)
Why should I complain? (Why complain?)
